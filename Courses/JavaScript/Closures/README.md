Closures

Closures are a programming pattern in JavaScript that allows variables from an outer lexical scope to be used inside of a nested block of code. JavaScript supports closures transparently, and they are often used without knowing what they are.

Closures
It is essentially what allows us to return a function A, from another function B, that remembers the local variables defined in B, even after B exits.
